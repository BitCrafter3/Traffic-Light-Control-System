 Introduction
 Traffic data analysis is crucial for understanding website
 engagement, user behaviour, and trends in visitor activity. This
 report examines traffic data based on parameters such as
 PageViews, Unique Visits, and Bounce Rate. The insights
 derived help in optimizing website performance and user
 experience.
 Methodology
 The methodology for this analysis is as follows:
1. Traffic Light Simulation Setup:
   o APythonscript was developed to simulate a traffic
   light system.
   o Thescript uses a loop to cycle through three traffic
   light states: Red, Green, and Yellow.
 2. Implementation Details:
   o Thetraffic light follows a sequence:
    Redlight stays on for 5 seconds.
    Greenlight stays on for 5 seconds.
    Yellow light stays on for 2 seconds.
   o Thetime.sleep() function is used to introduce delays
   between transitions.
 3. Continuous Execution:
   o Theprogramruns indefinitely to simulate a real
   traffic light.
   o Atry-except block is implemented to allow safe
   termination using KeyboardInterrupt.
 4. Code Testing:
   o Thescript was tested to ensure correct timing and
   transitions.
   o Thesystem output was observed to verify accurate
   light changes
